# Chalkboard Jeopardy
A chalkboard quiz game. Each round presents a random question from a past Jeopardy episode in a multiple-choice format. As the Jeopardy API supplies only the correct answer, the app generates the incorrect choice set; a series of calls to a dictionary API attempts to categorize the answer, then collect words from that category.

note: Due to service costs, the demo has been disconnected from the API. The gh-pages demo plays default questions.
